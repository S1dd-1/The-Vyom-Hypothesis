# The-Vyom-Hypothesis

## Abstract

The universe emerged from nothing, and thus must ultimately return to it. This paper introduces the concept of existence (Ϟ), defined as the measure of an entity’s complexity and interactability, and proposes that all entities tend towards a state of non-existence. Following this Occam’s Razer inspired postulate, this speculative framework attempts to unify diverse physical phenomena through intrinsic and extrinsic tendencies (pathways through which entities move toward non-existence). Several quantifiable relations are reinterpreted from this perspective: (a) Newton’s inverse-square law is derived from extrinsic tendencies, suggesting that fundamental forces are emergent; (b) the accelerated expansion of space-time appears natural as described by its own intrinsic tendency; and (c) the inverse-area dependence of Hawking radiation power can be interpreted as an extrinsic tendency acting upon a black hole by surrounding space-time, and increasing as the surface area decreases. However, this work remains an exploratory foundation; many characteristics of entities within this framework are still speculative or incomplete.
