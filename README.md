# Abstract

The universe emerged from nothing, and thus must ultimately return to it. This paper introduces the concept of existence ($\Koppa$), defined as a measure of an entity's complexity and interactability, and proposes that all entities strive to reach a non-existent state. It presents a speculative model that unifies diverse physical phenomena, including gravitational attraction, spacetime expansion, electromagnetism, and black holes, through intrinsic and extrinsic tendencies. Using this framework, fundamental forces are shown to arise as emergent behaviors of these tendencies, and known relations such as Newton's inverse-square law and Hawking radiation's inverse-area law are reinterpreted from a new perspective. However, this work remains an exploratory foundation; many characteristics of entities within the framework are still speculative or incomplete.
